      <p>Nelson Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, in Mvezo, South Africa, was a revolutionary leader, anti-apartheid activist, and philanthropist. He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999, becoming the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election.</p>
      <p>Mandela's presidency marked the end of decades of institutionalized racial segregation and discrimination in South Africa, known as apartheid. His leadership in the African National Congress (ANC) and his commitment to non-violent protest earned him global recognition and numerous awards, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.</p>
      <p>Mandela spent 27 years in prison for his political activities, during which time he became an international symbol of resistance to oppression. Upon his release in 1990, he led negotiations to dismantle apartheid and establish multiracial elections in 1994. His presidency focused on reconciliation between the country's racial groups and building a new democratic society.</p>
      <p>Nelson Mandela passed away on December 5, 2013, at the age of 95. His legacy continues to inspire millions around the world to fight for justice, equality, and human rights.</p></figcaption>
